# Thesis

[This Thesis](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/bitstream/handle/123456789/247716/PCNM0385-D.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) investigates the price dynamics of Ether across centralized and decentralized exchanges to contribute to the knowledge systematization of cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This study follows Alexander et al (2020) using autoregressive, including VECM, and cointegration models to investigate the price discovery dynamics between markets.
